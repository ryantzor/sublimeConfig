## Sublime Config

This is my sublime config file. 

Use the link below to find out where to clone the repo. Windows / OSX / And linux are all different locations
but eventually all point to the same "\User\" folder

## Usage

Clone this repo to your \User\ Folder mentioned above. Depending on version there could be errors. This was tested with 3 devices on Sublime 3, no errors. 

## Config Description

I mostly use sublime for Web Development. Reactjs Babel plugins are instead for JSX text highlighting, as well as a couple javascript quality of life enhancements
